Database-Typhoon version 0.01
=============================

This is a proof-of-concept to try to talk to a Typhoon Database
from a Perl program.
There is no flexibility, in that it only works with the database defined
in examples/, however changing of the field names for another database
should be a case of simply changing the routines in the xs file.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

You need to install the Typhoon library first.
That library can be downloaded from
https://github.com/jonahharris/osdb-typhoon.

TODO

Finish the routines.
Create import and export routines so that the place to be amended is one
small place.
Make it generic for any Typhoon database.
